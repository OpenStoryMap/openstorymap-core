          <strong>Liv Yoon, Principal Investigator</strong>
          <br>Dr. Liv Yoon's research is at the intersection of climate change, social inequities, and health, with a focus on community engagement work. As a social scientist, she approaches climate change as a sociopolitical crisis. Her research is focused on taking climate change as an opportunity to challenge the status quo and promote structural changes that alleviate social inequities that both led to, and are exacerbated by, the climate crisis. She is a Fellow with the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), and a member of Columbia's Environmental Justice and Climate Just Cities (EJCJC) Network. Dr. Yoon obtained her Ph.D. at The University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada, in Sociocultural Kinesiology. Her training in socio-cultural studies informs her to think about bodies in sociopolitical context. Applied to climate change, this means thinking about how some bodies are considered more 'dispensable', and in turn, rendered more vulnerable to climate-related risks and pollution.

          <strong>Christian Braneon, Co-Investigator</strong>
          <br>Dr. Christian Braneon is a climate scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Co-Director of the Environmental Justice and Climate Just Cities (EJCJC) Network at the Earth Institute. He previously served as Co-Director of USEPA's inaugural Environmental Justice Academy for community leaders. Dr. Braneon is particularly known for integrating satellite data and climate science into urban planning and civil engineering practice. In 2013, he developed an approach for integrating climate change projections into the City of Dallas Long Range Water Supply Plan. Recently, he advised New York City Council's Data Operations Unit on their data science strategy as they integrated Landsat 8 satellite imagery into their temperature mapping initiatives. Dr. Braneon received an AXA Award for Climate Science in 2021. He holds degrees in applied physics and civil engineering from Morehouse College and the Georgia Institute of Technology.
